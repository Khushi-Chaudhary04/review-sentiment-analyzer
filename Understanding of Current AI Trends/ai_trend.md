# Understanding of Current AI Trends

One significant development in AI over the past year has been the advancement and increased accessibility of large language models (LLMs), particularly models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini 1.0. These models have revolutionized the field by providing more accurate, context-aware, and human-like text generation capabilities.

**Importance:**
This development is crucial because it has broadened the applications of AI in numerous fields such as healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment. LLMs can now perform complex tasks such as summarizing long documents, generating creative content, answering detailed questions, and even writing code.

**Impact on the Field:**
The impact of these advancements is profound. For instance, in the field of education, AI can assist in personalized learning by providing tailored content and interactive tutoring. In healthcare, AI can help analyze medical records to provide insights and support clinical decisions.

**Real-Life Example:**
During my Google Immersion Week, I worked on a project that leverages these advancements. The project aimed to create an AI-powered app to recommend books and provide concise summaries based on user preferences. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the project:

- **Book Database:** We used the vast BigQuery public dataset of internet archive books as our comprehensive catalog.
- **AI Summarization Engine:** Using Google Cloud Functions with the Gemini 1.0 Pro language model, we generated insightful summaries tailored to user requests.
- **BigQuery Integration:** A remote function within BigQuery called our Cloud Function to deliver on-demand book summaries and themes.
- **User Interface:** We developed a web app hosted on Cloud Run, allowing users to view results.

This hands-on experience not only demonstrated the power of current AI advancements but also highlighted the potential for creating highly personalized and efficient applications that can significantly enhance user experiences.
